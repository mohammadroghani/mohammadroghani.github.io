I am a second year Ph.D. student at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Amin Saberi](https://web.stanford.edu/~saberi/). Before joining Stanford University, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/). In the summer of 2022, I was an intern in the **dynamic pricing** team at [Uber](https://www.uber.com/) working on riders' surge pricing.

I am broadly interested in **theoretical computer science**. More specifically, I am working on designing algorithms for large-scale graph problems and graph problems in an uncertain environment, which includes **sublinear algorithms**, **dynamic algorithms**, and **online algorithms**.
